This solution contains three projects: Komodo Cafe, Komodo Claims, and Komodo Greeting

1. Komodo Cafe - An application that allows the user to manage the menu of a cafe
    * add new menu items
    * remove menu items
    * view all menu items
    
2. Komodo Claims - An application that users can use to track and handle insurance claims
    * add new claims
    * handle claims
    * claims' validity is programmatically adjusted based on the date of the incident and the date the claim was filed

3. Komodo Greeting - An application that can manage customer data
    * add, edit, and remove customers
    * each customer has a custom greeting, determined by their customer type (current, past, or potential)
